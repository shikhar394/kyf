## Investment Terms Considerations

If proceeding with an investment, consider the following terms:

1. **Valuation**: Compare to similar stage companies in enterprise SaaS/AI space
2. **Investor Rights**: Information rights, pro-rata rights, board representation
3. **Protective Provisions**: Standard Series A terms vs. any unusual requests
4. **Liquidation Preference**: 1x non-participating is standard for Series A
5. **Vesting Schedules**: Ensure founder and key employee vesting aligns with growth timeline
6. **Anti-Dilution Protection**: Broad-based weighted average is standard

## Final Decision Framework

After completing due diligence, use this framework to make your final decision:

1. **Go**: Strong conviction in team, product, and market with acceptable risks
   - Consider leading or participating at target allocation

2. **Conditional Go**: Positive on opportunity but specific concerns need addressing
   - Consider participating with specific terms or smaller allocation

3. **No Go**: Significant concerns about market, product, team, or economics
   - Pass on the opportunity but maintain relationship for potential future rounds

4. **Revisit Later**: Promising opportunity but too early or needs more validation
   - Decline current round but establish clear milestones for reconsideration

## Post-Investment Value-Add Opportunities

If you decide to invest, consider how you can add value beyond capital:

1. **Strategic Introductions**: Enterprise customers, technology partners, follow-on investors
2. **Talent Recruitment**: Help identify and recruit key executives or technical talent
3. **Strategic Guidance**: Assist with pricing strategy, go-to-market approach, or product roadmap
4. **Operational Support**: Provide resources for financial planning, sales strategy, etc.
5. **Follow-On Financing**: Help position the company for successful future funding rounds
